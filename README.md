I am MD Al Amin, graduated with a Master's in Information System and Security from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, with work experiences in software engineering. I was born in Bhola, a district in Bangladesh, where I lived for 18 years. At school, I was always top of class on results, and I achieved scholarship twice. Then I moved to the capital, to study Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Institute of Science and Technology affiliated with the National University of Bangladesh, graduating with a First class degree and being in the top 3%. Due to my interest in information security, I later did a two years master’s in Information System and Security from Bangladesh University of Professionals.

Since 2010, next to my studies, I started developing for both local companies and international clients. In 2014 I started my first full time job joining a software company, Trancendio, helping clients develop digital products and services. There I worked in building an online platform for booking lodging, which gave me great experience in building a highly scalable application.
My next two experiences were also in software companies. At Skylark Soft, I joined as a senior software engineer and was given the responsibility of leading a team. Later, I joined Interconnection, a child company of Will & Skill AB (Sweden) and worked on developing software such as a product facilitating micro financing investments in the EU stock market, a retail platform, and most significantly on TouchBase, a social tool to streamline the work of Visual Merchandising.
In 2017, I moved to join a small startup named Pathao. I was one of its most significant contributors, in making it the most prominent startup company in Bangladesh ($100 million valuation in 2018). I have seen the company grow from zero to later impacting many people’s lives in Bangladesh and Nepal, through its bike and car sharing, courier, and food delivery services. One of my biggest achievements was rewriting its dispatch system and scaling it up to increase its revenue by 40%. I was the lead engineer for building the food delivery platform Pathao Food, which is currently one of the top revenue sources for Pathao.

After that in 2020, I moved to the Netherlands to join and co-found a startup named NearOnes. I joined as a Co-founder and technical director, led the development team and launched our product within three months in Amsterdam. While building innovative technology at NearOnes, I led projects that granted us two WBSO grants from RVO.

I am an Open Source Contributor, and was an active member of the tech community in Bangladesh. I am an active moderator of the Go Developer Network and Rust Programming Groups of the country, and has successfully arranged the Go Developer Meetup Dhaka in 2018 as an organizer and a speaker. I have been a volunteering member of Mozilla Bangladesh, Google Developer Group, and also volunteered in two conferences, International Conference On Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (2012) and PyCon Dhaka (2016).

In 2015, I won the Code Warrior Challenge Award, organized by Ministry of ICT, Bangladesh and Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services.
I enjoy in my free time getting to know new people and places, engaging in blog writing and reading about new tech, science and entrepreneurship.
